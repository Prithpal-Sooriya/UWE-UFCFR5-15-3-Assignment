# PHP PRACTICE
- going through the tutorials on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp) to get used to some basic PHP.

- using the [php-server](https://atom.io/packages/php-server) to start a server that understands php.
  - the atom-live-server did not support php...
  - windows path used (was a fucking nightmare...): C:\php\php --> the \php\php = php folder\php exe
- using [live-reload](https://atom.io/packages/livereload) to auto reload the web page
  - need to install the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)
  - need to run live reload (ctrl-shift-r, it will show at the bottom of atom)
  - need to paste the URL link into a <script "javascript/text"> </script> tag

locations for php information
- a ton of youtube.
- [how php works with web server/browser](https://stillat.com/blog/2014/04/02/how-does-php-work-with-the-web-server-and-browser)
  - need to start up a php server (e.g. apache or something)
    - server sends php code to an interpreter and waits for a responce.
    - server will get output from interpreter.
    - server will send output back to browser to render on screen.
