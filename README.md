[Link to the report](https://github.com/Prithpal-Sooriya/UWE-UFCFR5-15-3-Assignment/blob/master/Report.md)

Note, this repo will need a `config.js` file which must contain:
```JavaScript
var config = {
  MAP_KEY : "Key code"
};
```

`MAP_KEY` is the Google Maps key. You can find out how to get one from [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
